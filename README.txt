Welcome to my project
At the moment bcrypt and pretty tables are needed
This program works by creating 2 files, a password file, where the password is encrypted and stored
and create a database file (location.db) to store informations which is then printed on the screen

To install requirements :
- python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
